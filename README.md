# MemorEyes

MemorEyes is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

This simple game app was adapted from General Assembly's [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) learning curriculum.

## Features

* Board resets per round with shuffled cards.

* Get the second card to show that it's flipped over. ✓
* Disable card flipping after the game is over. ✓
* Use modals instead of confirm alerts.
* Add a reset button instead of a prompt.
* Implement a way to keep track of and display the user's score.
* Create breakpoints for widths > 640px, test for mobile responsiveness.
